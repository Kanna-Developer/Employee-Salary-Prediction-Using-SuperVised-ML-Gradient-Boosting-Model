📌 Project Overview: Employee Salary Prediction System

🔍 Problem Statement

To automate salary classification based on employee features like age, education, job role, work hours, and experience. The goal is to predict whether an individual earns >50K or ≤50K, helping HR teams make data-driven decisions for compensation analysis.

🔧 System Approach

📋 System Requirements

Requirement

Details

Platform

Jupyter Notebook, Streamlit

Language

Python 3.8+

Libraries

pandas, scikit-learn, joblib, streamlit

Hardware

Basic desktop/laptop (4GB RAM min)

📚 Libraries Used

pandas – Data manipulation and batch processing

scikit-learn – Preprocessing, model building, evaluation

joblib – Save/load trained pipelines

streamlit – Deploy interactive web app

matplotlib - For visualizing graph

🧠 Algorithmic Flow (Step-by-Step Breakdown)

1. Import required libraries and upload CSV dataset
2. Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, drop redundant features)
3. Detect outliers and remove unnecessary entries
4. Transform categorical data using LabelEncoder or OneHotEncoder
5. Split data into training and testing sets using train_test_split()
6. Train and compare multiple models (GradientBoosting, SVM, etc.)
7. Save best-performing model with joblib
8. Integrate model with Streamlit web app interface
9. Deploy Streamlit app to the cloud for global access

📎 Tip: The entire workflow is embedded into a Pipeline object to ensure consistent data transformation during training and prediction.

Here's the logical flow you can use in a PowerPoint or README:

┌───────────────┐
│ Data Upload   │
└─────┬─────────┘
      ↓
┌───────────────┐
│ Preprocessing │ ← Outlier removal + label encoding
└─────┬─────────┘
      ↓
┌───────────────┐
│ Split Dataset │
└─────┬─────────┘
      ↓
┌───────────────┐
│ Model Train   │ ← Multiple classifiers compared
└─────┬─────────┘
      ↓
┌───────────────┐
│ Save Pipeline │
└─────┬─────────┘
      ↓
┌───────────────┐
│ Streamlit UI │ ← User inputs + batch CSV upload
└─────┬─────────┘
      ↓
┌───────────────┐
│ Cloud Deploy  │ ← Streamlit Cloud or GCP
└───────────────┘

🚀 Deployment Strategy

✅ Local Development

streamlit run Salary_Prediction.py

🌐 Streamlit Cloud

Push to GitHub

Deploy at streamlit.io/cloud

Optional: We can containerize this using Docker for GCP deployment if needed.

✅ Conclusion

This system empowers HR professionals and data analysts with:

Real-time salary prediction for individual or batch employee profiles

Scalable interface via Streamlit

Robust, reproducible ML pipeline using industry-standard libraries

With proper deployment, it can serve as a lightweight decision-support tool for small to mid-sized enterprises.
